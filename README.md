CMSC 724 Spring 2015 Databases Final Project code. This code contains a series of benchmarks for the Neo4j, OrientDB, and Titan Databases all of which are run through java. The database libraries have not been included. When setting up the files, at the top there is a numberOfNodes and fileSet, the numberOfNodes should equal the number of verticies that will be created, and the fileSet should be a directory where a networks.dat file can be found containing two two numbers representing a connection between two vertices.

For example:
1	180
1	327
1	453
1	522
1	685
2	38
2	497
2	634
2	652
2	831
3	210
3	573

The smaller datasets have been uploaded here on github. The others were simply too large to upload. If you would like them we can try to get them to you in some other manner.
